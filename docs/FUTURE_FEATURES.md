# Future Features & Ideas

Planned improvements and feature ideas for FinBot. Use this as a backlog: add new items here and move/cross out when implemented.

---

## Backlog

- **Date picker: sliding / roulette** — In the add-expense Mini App, the date picker should be a sliding/roulette control so users can move a few days back easily instead of jumping by month.

- **Duplicate entry check on create** — When creating an entry (expense/settlement), check if a similar one already exists and prompt the user. Match on: category + value + date (optionally date span). Let the user confirm or cancel.

## Adding items

- One idea per bullet; keep the line short and add a second line of detail if needed.
- Optionally prefix with area: `[Mini App]`, `[Agent]`, `[Telegram]`, `[API]`, etc.
- When something is implemented, move it to an "Done" section at the bottom or remove it.
